\newlabel{fig:effplot}{{1}{1}{This plot shows the fidelity of the best organism in a ten-organism set after $100$ generations with respect to mutation chance and mutation magnitude. The vertical axis, when the value is multiplied by $0.1$, gives the chance in any generation for one of the angles defining an organism to be mutated. The horizontal axis, when multiplied by $0.025$, gives the mutation magnitude (this ranges between $0$ and $1$ radian(s)). The plot shows clear correlation between mutation magnitude and organism success.\relax }{Doc-Start}{}}
